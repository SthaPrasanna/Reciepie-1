    <h4>Almost-Famous Barbecue Chicken Pizza</h4>

    <p>
      When California Pizza Kitchen’s cofounders created their first menu back
      in 1985, they had a theory: Anything that makes a great sandwich would
      make an even better pizza. Not all of the chain’s sandwich-inspired pies
      have been a success (egg-salad pizza was a flop in the late ’80s), but the
      combo of barbecue sauce and chicken on a crust turned out to be a winning
      formula. The Original BBQ Chicken Pizza has been the chain’s top seller
      ever since — and Food Network Kitchens figured out the recipe so you can
      make a perfect copy at home.

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>1 teaspoon extra-virgin olive oil, plus more for brushing</li>
      <li>1/2 pound prepared pizza dough, at room temperature</li>
      <li>1/3 cup plus 2 tablespoons dark barbecue sauce</li>
      <li>1 8-ounce skinless, boneless chicken breast</li>
      <li>Kosher salt and freshly ground pepper</li>
      <li>2/3 cup grated smoked gouda cheese (about 3 ounces)</li>
      <li>2/3 cup grated part-skim mozzarella cheese (about 3 ounces)</li>
      <li>1/2 small red onion, thinly sliced</li>
      <li>Fresh cilantro, for topping</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Brush a large bowl with olive oil. Shape the pizza dough into a ball,
        add it to the bowl and turn to coat with the oil. Cover tightly with
        plastic wrap and set aside in a warm place, 30 to 40 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Position racks in the upper third and middle of the oven. Place a pizza
        stone or inverted baking sheet on the top rack and preheat the oven to
        425 degrees F for at least 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Meanwhile, lay out a sheet of parchment paper and brush with olive oil.
        Transfer the ball of dough to the parchment and roll it out into a
        10-inch round, stretching it with your hands as needed. Lightly brush
        the dough with olive oil, cover with another piece of parchment and set
        aside to let rise slightly, about 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        While the dough rises, mix 2 tablespoons barbecue sauce and 1 teaspoon
        olive oil in a small bowl. Put the chicken in a baking dish, season with
        salt and pepper and brush with the barbecue sauce mixture. Bake on the
        middle oven rack until cooked through, about 20 minutes. Let cool, then
        cut into 1/2-inch cubes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Uncover the dough and spread with the remaining 1/3 cup barbecue sauce,
        leaving a 3/4-inch border. Top with the chicken, gouda, mozzarella and
        red onion. Slide the pizza (on the parchment) onto a pizza peel or
        another inverted baking sheet, then slide onto the hot stone or baking
        sheet; bake until the cheese melts and the crust is golden, 20 to 25
        minutes. Sprinkle with cilantro.
